"Fertilizer Type Prediction" involves using data analysis and machine learning to identify the most appropriate fertilizer for specific crops or soil conditions. This approach optimizes agricultural practices, enhances crop yield, and supports sustainable farming by ensuring that the right nutrients are applied in the correct amounts, ultimately leading to healthier crops and improved soil quality.

# Fertilizer Type Prediction  

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for predicting the optimal fertilizer type based on various factors such as soil conditions, crop type, and other relevant features.  

## Prerequisites  

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:  

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)  

You can install the required libraries using pip:  

```bash  
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
